| Tutorial | Introduction and usage tutorial for this project | ![image](https://github.com/zhulinyv/Semi-Auto-NovelAI-to-Pixiv/blob/main/files/imgs/15.png?raw=true) | Please read carefully |
| Text-to-Image | A user interface for NovelAI written using Gradio, functionally identical to the NovelAI website except for the interface | ![image](https://github.com/zhulinyv/Semi-Auto-NovelAI-to-Pixiv/blob/main/files/imgs/1.png?raw=true) | Generated images will be saved in the `./output/t2i` folder |
| Random NSFW | Generates a NSFW image by randomly combining tags from `./files/favorite.json`, or infinitely generates NSFW images | ![image](https://github.com/zhulinyv/Semi-Auto-NovelAI-to-Pixiv/blob/main/files/imgs/3.png?raw=true) | For configuration of random NSFW, refer to the section on random NSFW in [Other Configurations](https://github.com/zhulinyv/Semi-Auto-NovelAI-to-Pixiv#%E5%85%B6%E5%AE%83%E9%85%8D%E7%BD%AE) |
| Random Image | Infinitely generates images by reading `*.txt` files in `./file/prompt` and appending the entered prompts, stops when all `*.txt` files in the folder have been processed or stopped manually | ![image](https://github.com/zhulinyv/Semi-Auto-NovelAI-to-Pixiv/blob/main/files/imgs/4.png?raw=true) | For configuration of random images, refer to the section on random images in [Other Configurations](https://github.com/zhulinyv/Semi-Auto-NovelAI-to-Pixiv#%E5%85%B6%E5%AE%83%E9%85%8D%E7%BD%AE) |
| Image-to-Image | Functionally identical to using the NovelAI website, supports any image, additionally supports batch image-to-image generation | ![image](https://github.com/zhulinyv/Semi-Auto-NovelAI-to-Pixiv/blob/main/files/imgs/2.png?raw=true) | Generated images will be saved in the `./output/i2i` folder, but a temporary image named `temp.png` will be generated in the `./output` folder, which can be deleted. For batch processing, place images in the same folder, e.g., `./output/choose_to_i2i` |
| Local Redraw | Supports images generated by NovelAI only, requires uploading a mask, supports batch operations | ![image](https://github.com/zhulinyv/Semi-Auto-NovelAI-to-Pixiv/blob/main/files/imgs/5.png?raw=true) | Uploaded mask should have white areas for redrawing and transparent areas for retaining original, resolution should match the image to redraw. For batch operations, place images and masks in separate folders, ensuring filenames match, e.g., `./output/inpaint/img`, `./output/inpaint/mask`, generated images will be saved in `./output/inpaint` |
| Vibe | Functionally identical to using the NovelAI website, with added batch functionality | ![image](https://github.com/zhulinyv/Semi-Auto-NovelAI-to-Pixiv/blob/main/files/imgs/16.png?raw=true) | Prepare images in the same folder, rename them in the format `(any_name_without_underscores)_(information_extracted, float(0, 1))_(strength, float(0, 1)).png)`, e.g., `hoshino-hinata_1.0_0.6`, when the random NSFW option is checked, infinite generation will follow the pattern of random NSFW images. When unchecked, infinite generation will follow the pattern of random images |
| Super-Resolution Denoising | Applies super-resolution denoising to images using open-source projects listed in the [Acknowledgments](https://github.com/zhulinyv/Semi-Auto-NovelAI-to-Pixiv#-%E9%B8%A3%E8%B0%A2), supports single or batch processing | ![image](https://github.com/zhulinyv/Semi-Auto-NovelAI-to-Pixiv/blob/main/files/imgs/6.png?raw=true) | Generated images will be saved in the `./output/upscale` folder. Avoid using **srmd-cuda** due to instability. When using **waifu2x-caffe** or **waifu2x-converter**, a temporary batch file named `temp.bat` will be generated in the `./output` folder, which can be deleted. For batch processing, place images in the same folder, e.g., `./output/choose_to_upscale` |
| Auto Mosaic | Automatically detects key areas in images and applies mosaic, may not detect 100% accurately, supports batch processing | ![image](https://github.com/zhulinyv/Semi-Auto-NovelAI-to-Pixiv/blob/main/files/imgs/7.png?raw=true) | Generated images will be saved in the `./output/mosaic` folder. For batch processing, place images in the same folder, e.g., `./output/choose_to_mosaic` |
| Add Watermark | Adds a random watermark with specified opacity to random positions (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right) of images | ![image](https://github.com/zhulinyv/Semi-Auto-NovelAI-to-Pixiv/blob/main/files/imgs/8.png?raw=true) | Prepare your own watermarks in the `./files/water` folder. Enter the directory of images to process, processed images will be saved in `./output/water` |
| Upload to Pixiv | Batch uploads images to Pixiv | ![image](https://github.com/zhulinyv/Semi-Auto-NovelAI-to-Pixiv/blob/main/files/imgs/9.png?raw=true) | For Pixiv upload configuration, refer to the section on Pixiv upload in [Other Configurations](https://github.com/zhulinyv/Semi-Auto-NovelAI-to-Pixiv#%E5%85%B6%E5%AE%83%E9%85%8D%E7%BD%AE) |
| Image Filtering | Tool for manually filtering images | ![image](https://github.com/zhulinyv/Semi-Auto-NovelAI-to-Pixiv/blob/main/files/imgs/10.png?raw=true) | Enter the image directory and output directory. A file named `array_data.npy` will be generated in the `./output` folder, saving progress for later sessions. |
| Data Erasure | Batch erases, restores, or exports image generation information | ![image](https://github.com/zhulinyv/Semi-Auto-NovelAI-to-Pixiv/blob/main/files/imgs/11.png?raw=true) | For restoration, prepare *.png images with prompts or *.txt files containing prompts, filenames in the selected restoration directory must match those in the prompt information directory |
| Magic Parser | Reads PNG info using open-source projects listed in the [Acknowledgments](https://github.com/zhulinyv/Semi-Auto-NovelAI-to-Pixiv#-%E9%B8%A3%E8%B0%A2) | ![image](https://github.com/zhulinyv/Semi-Auto-NovelAI-to-Pixiv/blob/main/files/imgs/12.png?raw=true) | Nested into this project via iframe |
| GPT Free | Free, multi-model GPT using open-source projects listed in the [Acknowledgments](https://github.com/zhulinyv/Semi-Auto-NovelAI-to-Pixiv#-%E9%B8%A3%E8%B0%A2) | ![image](https://github.com/zhulinyv/Semi-Auto-NovelAI-to-Pixiv/blob/main/files/imgs/13.png?raw=true) | Nested into this project via iframe |
| Configuration Settings | Change configuration items in the WebUI | ![image](https://github.com/zhulinyv/Semi-Auto-NovelAI-to-Pixiv/blob/main/files/imgs/14.png?raw=true) | Remember to save changes, changes take effect immediately after restart |
